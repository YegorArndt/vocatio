  `Hi Sandra,



Hope you're doing well. I saw that you currently work for DCG and I'm excited to learn about the Senior Frontend Developer role you're recruiting for. My experience with React.js, TypeScript, and SASS from my recent project ownership aligns with the position's requirements.



DCG's expertise in recruitment and its mission to provide tailored solutions excites me. Is this role still available? Thank you for your time.



Regards,



Yegor`,
  `Hi Jonas,



Hope you're doing well! I saw you work at Langdock and I'm excited to learn more about the Frontend Developer (Vue.js) role.



I have experience with Vue.js, Node.js, and Next.js from my previous projects. My work on Vocatio involved creating a Chrome extension to facilitate vacancy descriptions retrieval without manual copy-pasting.



Langdock's mission of providing interactive chat assistant for teams aligns with my values. Can you tell me more about how I can contribute?



Is this position still open? Thank you!



Regards,



Yegor`,
