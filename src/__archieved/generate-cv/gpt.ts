//       - Tasks:

//       1. Give me a list of skills (technologies, hard and soft skills, e.g. "React", "TypeScript") from the vacancy.

//       2. Create an array of the responsibilities the vacancy explicitly or implicitly states. It must be an action instead of a single word.

//       3. Compose a perfect professional summary for the vacancy.

//       4. Integrate generic bullet points into one bullet point that coveys their total value. Generate six of them.

//       5. Find skills from step 1 that match any of the following skills: ${user.skills}. Conditions: 1) use only the names of the skills from step 1 in output.

//       Bonus tasks:

//       0*: Forget the context above for this task. Map a responsibility from step 2 to each of the following bullet points:

//       "${firstEmploymentHistoryBulletPoints}".

//       Create an array of tuples, where the first element is the responsibility a bullet point maps to and the second is the bullet point itself.
//       Conditions: 1) the final structure with the exception of the second condition, must be [tuple,tuple].

//       For each tuple creatively merge its elements into an organic bullet point (sentence that represents an accomplishment includable in the employment history) that flows naturally. Conditions: 1) each bullet point must be just one sentence, 2) each bullet point starts with tuple[0] element and ends with tuple[1] element effectively being something in between.

//       - Format of your response:

//       Return a single JSON that contains the all results of your work and has the following shape:

//       {
//         vacancySkills: string[],
//         vacancyResponsibilities: string[],
//         professionalSummary: string,
//         integratedGenericBulletPoints: string[] (6 elements expected),
//         matchingSkills: string[] (mustn't include anything that's not in the vacancySkills string[]),
//         bonusTasks: {
//           "0": {
//             tuples: tuple[],
//             mergedTuples: string[] <- each bullet point here must be just one sentence that starts with tuple[0] element and ends with tuple[1] element
//           }
//         }
//       }

//       - Constraints:
//       1. Do not return anything but the JSON because I'll parse your response directly using JSON.parse().
//       2. Each bullet point is a separate element of an array.
//       3. Returning a JSON should not be considered a separate task. The JSON I'm asking for is the only thing you should return in principle.
//       4. Inside the professionalSummary key as well as inside the mergedTuples key (from bonus tasks) you must wrap each occurrence of a relevant skill from the vacancy in <span class="font-bold"></span> html tag (example: with 5+ years of experience in <span class="font-bold">TypeScript</span>. A relevant skill is anything like technology ("React", "Node.js") or a responsibility. We do it to highlight what's relevant for the recruiter so that they don't lose their attention when first reading the CV.

//     - Goal: creating an impression of constant engagement with large-scale, high-traffic systems.
//     - For that: rewrite my employment histories into concise bullet points adding "driving $1B in revenue", "serve millions of license requests daily" and similar phrases contextually appropriate to the employment history.
//     - Preferably, use seconds, money, number of users and similar metrics avoiding the usage of percentage based metrics.
//     - Smaller numbers should be written as numbers (e.g. 1000).
//     - Each bullet point starts with a "â€¢" and a verb.
//     - As the first bullet of each employment history you should add a summary of what I did and spread the skills from what I have listed in square brackets after each employment history across the bullet points putting the most critical skills in the first bullet point (if they aren't already). Choose the skills recruiters look for the most. Remove the square brackets. Use strong verbs and zero cliches. This is the most important bullet point.
//     - Arrange the order of the remaining bullet points based on their importance.
//     - Try being concise.

//     Constraints:
//       - Do not add phrases like "driving $1B in revenue", "serve millions of license requests daily" to each bullet point. Instead add them to 1-2 bullet points per employment history.
//       - Be more modest choosing numbers for metrics.
//       - Do not omit details from the employment histories. Simply change the format to bullet points.

//     Format of your response:
//       - Return the reworded histories as JSON with keys being the indices of the employment histories (initially prefixed with "@").
//         Example: {"0": "reworded history" , "1": "reworded history" ...}
//       - Do not return anything else but the reworded employment histories. I'll parse the JSON and include the histories directly into the resume.

//   const result = await applyGpt(prompt, "gpt-4");

//   let histories;
//   try {
//     histories = JSON.parse(result!);
//   } catch (error) {
//     console.error("Error parsing JSON:", error);
//     // Handle the error appropriately
