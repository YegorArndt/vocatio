  //   story: `As a Full Stack Developer at A-ADS, I utilized my skills in TypeScript, Next.js,
  //     TailwindCSS, to architect a robust cryptocurrency advertising platform catering to both
  //     publishers and advertisers. The system I developed streamlined the processes of ad
  //     placement, audience targeting, and campaign management, ultimately increasing user
  //     engagement and driving revenue growth.
  //     To complement this, I designed sophisticated algorithms for calculating commissions
  //     based on the usage of our service. These algorithms took into account various factors like
  //     user activity, ad performance, and market dynamics to ensure a fair and transparent
  //     commission structure.
  //     Understanding the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, I incorporated real-time market
  //     data into our platform. This allowed us to adjust pricing models and strategies
  //     dynamically, maximizing profitability for our users and our platform.
  //     Additionally, I took the initiative to migrate our codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript,
  //     improving code maintainability and aligning with modern development standards. Further
  //     enhancing our platform's user engagement, I developed a blog website. This platform
  //     provided valuable insights and resources for the crypto advertising community, further
  //     solidifying A-ADS's brand authority and driving organic traffic to our main platform.
  //     This blend of strategic development, intricate algorithm design, and user-focused
  //     enhancements not only elevated A-ADS's market presence but also ensured its platform
  //     remained a preferred choice in the ever-evolving crypto advertising landscape.`,
