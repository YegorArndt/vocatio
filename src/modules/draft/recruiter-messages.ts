  `Hi Sandra,



Hope you're doing well. I saw that you currently work for DCG and I'm excited to learn about the Senior Frontend Developer role you're recruiting for. My experience with React.js, TypeScript, and SASS from my recent project ownership aligns with the position's requirements.



DCG's expertise in recruitment and its mission to provide tailored solutions excites me. Is this role still available? Thank you for your time.



Regards,



Yegor`,
