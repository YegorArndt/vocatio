  Your task: rewrite my professional summary as well as the employment histories to completely (!) match the vacancy requirements. Wrap the key required skills (e.g. "React") with <b>React</b> html tag. I'll parse your response into HTML.

  Context:

    Vacancy requirements: "${vacancy.requiredSkills}".
    My professional summary: "${user.professionalSummary}".
    My employment histories: "${experience}".

  Format of your response:

    1. Prefix each employment history entry with an "@" followed by its index (zero-based). Do not prefix the summary.
    2. Each employment history must end up as a collection of 3-4 most relevant bullet points. Each bullet point must start with a "â€¢" and a verb. Maintain first person narrative. If there's lack of relevance in the original bullet points, just create a new one mirroring the vacancy requirements.
    3. Wrap all relevant skills with <b> html tag (e.g. <b>React</b>). I'll parse your response into HTML.
    4. Keep the <i/> tags intact.
    5. Return the summary before the histories.
    6. Make the summary short, concise. It must be a single sentence.
